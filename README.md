# Introduction 
This repo holds all the common libraries, utilities, components and some boiler plate projects. :dash:

## Getting Started
Individual parent folder host different set of libraries :innocent:. Any change to any one of the project will create a new package version of the libraries to the standards feed :boom:.

## Issues
If the new packages are not needed edit the pipeline to disable the packaging.
If new packages are not being created to even after the build, probably the space to hold packages are exeeded. Try to remove any version of the package if not being used(Check the download count in feed).
